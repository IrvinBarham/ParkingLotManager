# ParkingLotManager
Customers can create reservations and create profiles. There is a specific dataset that the program relies upon to make sure a customer can't request a reservation that is already taken. Additonally, new reservations update the dataset and new customers can be seen within the Admin reports. 

Admins are given special authority to edit existing users and are able to view sale, parking lot, and user reports. They can edit each trait of an employee and customer individually. 

Employees can set reservations for customers, and they can view their own salaries. 

The User Interface creates a friendly environment and makes the process very swift and easy. The system loops to run until it is totally terminated, which makes it even more convenient. 

Each update to the data is made in SQL queries.
